# Some notes on cluster launchers:
# Documentation: https://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=596209#p596209
# IMPORTANT: AutoRegister;ClusterManager plugins must be present and loaded!
# CMD_registationEmail: 
#    the email address used to register each cluster instance username automatically, note 
#    that the cluster instance needs admin powers on uberserver to autoregister new accounts
# CMD_baseGamePort:
#    the port the dedicated spring server will run on, should be forwarded or open, and all 
#    instances will use increasing numbers of this host 
#    (e.g. host 4 will use CMD_baseGamePort+4, e.g. 53200)
# CMD_baseAutoHostPort: 
#    the port that SPADS will use to comminicate with the dedicated server, will be used 
#    incrementally for instances, but does not have to be open to outside. Make sure the port 
#    ranges do not overlap with baseGamePort
# CMD_lobbyLogin: 
#    the username of the cluster manager instance
# CMD_lobbyPassword: 
#    the password of the cluster manager instance in plaintext
# if your engine is located here: 
# /home/eru/spads/var/spring/spring_bar_.BAR.104.0.1-1714-g321b911_linux-64-minimal-portable/ 
# then see the two presets below: 
# CMD_enginesBaseDir: 
#    the path to the base dir of the engine, with trailing slash, e.g.
#    CMD_enginesBaseDir=/home/eru/spads/var/spring/ 
# CMD_engineDir: 
#    the name of the directory where current engine is, with trailing slash, e.g.: 
#    spring_bar_.BAR.104.0.1-1714-g321b911_linux-64-minimal-portable/
# CMD_springDataDir: 
#    where the maps and game is located, with trailing slash, e.g.: 
#    /home/eru/spads/var/spring/data
# CMD_localLanIp: 
#    if you plan to play from the same LAN as the autohosts are located, you need to specify this, 
#    e.g. 192.168.1.102
# CMD_hostRegion:
#    The region name of the hosted battle, will be put into the battleName hosting preset in 
#    hostingpresets.conf like:  
#    battleName:%CMD_hostRegion%%ClustInstNb2% 
#    e.g. CMD_hostRegion="EU - " with the quotes and the spaces will be EU - 02 for instance 2
# Dont forget the trailing backslashes at the ends of lines!
