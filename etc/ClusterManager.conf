# The list of comma-separated SPADS global presets which must be instanciated as
# clusters.
# Each global preset listed here will generate its own cluster of instances
# based on this preset. Only "full presets" (i.e. presets defining all preset
# settings) are usable as cluster preset.
# If this setting is left empty, it is the same as if it was only containing the
# current SPADS default preset: ClusterManager is in mono-cluster mode.

# The list of comma-separated SPADS data that will be shared between the
# instances started by the cluster manager.
# It is recommended to share all possible data so that players and admins will
# get consistent behavior among the instances.
# Notice: The standard Perl DBD::SQLite module from CPAN is required to share
# preferences data. This module is normally already included by default on
# Windows, but on Linux system you may need to install it using the
# "apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-perl" command for example (depending on your
# distribution).

#   2 = auto-registration enabled for all instances, cluster manager included

# The base game port, used to generate the "port" hosting setting of SPADS which

# Specify if instances must share the same Spring data archive cache, or if
# each instance must manage its own cache. Sharing cache speeds-up archive
# loading process, but it is more prone to race conditions and write access
# conflicts. Using SPADS sequential unitsync mode is strongly recommended when
# enabling shared archive cache.
# Shared cache are implemented by creating symbolic links instead of copying
# the content of the "cache" folder of the manager instance when initializing
